**PyAuto Operator** is a next-generation hybrid automation platform designed for high-frequency trading and visual intelligence in gaming environments. Built on a **Rusty-Tauri** architecture, it combines the flexibility of Python with the raw performance and security of Rust.

## 🛡️ The Fortress Architecture (Security)

This software is protected by military-grade encryption and hardware-locked licensing.

*   **Ed25519 Signatures**: Every copy is cryptographically signed.
*   **HWID Locking**: Use is restricted to specific authorized hardware.
*   **Opaque Core**: The Rust engine logic is compiled and stripped, ensuring proprietary algorithms remain secure.

## ⚡ Core Features

### Hybrid Engine (Rust + Python)
*   **Eye (Python)**: Utilizing optimized `mss` and `EasyOCR` pipelines for 45FPS+ visual analysis.
*   **Brain (Rust)**: Zero-latency logic processing and state management.
*   **Hand (Win32)**: Direct driver-level input simulation for anti-detection.

### Visual Intelligence
*   **Real-time OCR**: Dynamic text recognition with fuzzy logic correction.
*   **Smart Filtering**: Rarity-based and Price-based trigger conditions.
*   **Visual Overlay**: Augmented Reality (AR) HUD rendering on top of the game stream.

### Compliance & Safety
*   **Liability Waiver**: Strict non-negotiable agreement on startup.
*   **Humanized Input**: Stochastic delay algorithms to mimic human reaction times.
